## Goal
Develop a comprehensive market entry strategy and risk analysis for the RFP that can be found within the KPMG_strategyteam_project entity

## Generated Plan

The plan for developing a comprehensive market entry strategy and risk analysis for the RFP found within the KPMG_strategyteam_project entity involves using KPMG's standard market entry strategy framework, incorporating established consulting methodologies, and ensuring alignment with client expectations and KPMG quality standards.

The plan consists of four steps: Conduct Market Analysis, Assess Competitive Landscape, Conduct Risk Analysis, and Develop Comprehensive Market Entry Strategy. Each step has a specific deliverable, timeline, resources, and quality check to ensure that the plan meets KPMG quality standards and provides actionable insights.

The plan also includes a review of the report by the KPMG strategy team to ensure that it meets quality standards and provides actionable insights.
