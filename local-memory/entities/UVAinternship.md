## Research Proposal Details

### Title
Type of Framing in Client Proposals

### Organization
KPMG Strategy & Deals intern position
- Global consulting firm (consulting, law, audit, tax, M&A restructuring)
- Role: Supporting large projects by creating proposals based on RFPs
- Also leading AI project: Creating KPMG-specific RAG (retrieval augmented generation) system using KPMG data

### Research Question
To what extent does the framing style in executive summaries (data-driven or narrative-driven) influence or affect the ratings of clarity and persuasiveness?

### Introduction/Background
- Proposal writing is essential to consultancy
- Big firms compete for lucrative contracts through short documents
- How a message is framed greatly affects persuasive prowess
- Data-driven frames appeal to logic; narrative frames engage readers emotionally
- KPMG invests heavily in proposals
- Research will test persuasive styles in professional context (less studied than consumer advertising)

### Methodology
- Between-subjects experiment
- Stimuli: Two short versions (150-200 words) of the same proposal summary
  * Same message, different presentation
  * Data frame: statistics and graphs
  * Narrative frame: short client success story
- Convenience sampling: At least 80 participants
- Each participant reads only one version
- Participants rate: clarity, persuasiveness, willingness to proceed with KPMG

### Learning Objectives
- Apply communication science theories (framing theory, transportation theory, ELM)
- Gain practical experience writing persuasive messages
- Learn to design messages for high-stake proposals
- Gain research skills through communication science-based research
- Reflect critically on contributions and feedback from colleagues

## Teacher Feedback (Pavlos Ferlachidis)

1. MISSING: Global timetable for the research

2. METHODOLOGY - Change to between-subjects design
   - Current: within-subjects (each participant reads both versions)
   - Suggested: between-subjects (each participant sees only one version)
   - Reason: Otherwise ends up with semi-experiment

3. SAMPLE SIZE: At least 80 participants needed (not 20-30)

4. DATA FRAME: What data frame? (needs clarification)

5. RESEARCH QUESTION - Wording issues:
   - Change "leads to" to "influences or affects"
   - Change to "To what extent does..."

6. SCIENTIFIC RELEVANCE: Can be more concrete
   - Need clearer relevance for host organization (KPMG)

7. TOPIC DEPTH: Should be explained in more depth
   - Must be clear why this is a communication science relevant study

8. TONE: Should be consistent with academic paper (not in first person)

9. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: More extensive and specific explanation needed
   - Around one page total
   - Need to explain which theories/concepts from coursework will be used during studies
   - How will these be used to complete assigned tasks

10. SIMPLIFY LANGUAGE: Try to explain concepts that are not common knowledge in simple words

11. APA INDENTATION: Needs proper formatting

12. ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION: Needs much more extensive explanation
   - The organization, position, and tasks assigned
   - Around half a page to a bit more for each section
