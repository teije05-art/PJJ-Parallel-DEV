**Rejection Reason:** Plan confuses RFP response development with project execution. We need to create the PROPOSAL DOCUMENT (methodology, team credentials, approach, pricing) to WIN the project, not execute the market study itself. The RFP response should outline HOW we would conduct the study, not actually conduct it.

**Rejection Reason:** This plan describes HOW TO EXECUTE the Vietnam market study project itself (conducting market analysis, competitive assessment, etc.). What we need is a plan for WRITING THE RFP PROPOSAL DOCUMENT that will win the project. The RFP response needs: Executive Summary, Methodology Section, Team Credentials, Past Experience, Deliverables Description, Timeline, Pricing. We're creating a SALES DOCUMENT, not executing the study.
