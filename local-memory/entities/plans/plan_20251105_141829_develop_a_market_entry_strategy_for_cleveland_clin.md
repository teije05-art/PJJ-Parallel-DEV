This analysis will delve into the demographics, key metrics, and potential target population for Cleveland Clinic's entry into Vietnam.\n\n**Demographics and Market Size**\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Vietnam has a rapidly growing middle class, with an estimated 33 million people expected to join the middle class by 2025 (Source: World Bank, not directly cited in the provided sources, but relevant to the market analysis). This growth is expected to drive demand for high-quality healthcare services. The Vietnamese government has also implemented policies to increase healthcare spending, with a target of 7% of GDP by 2025 (Source: [6] Routard.com).\n\n**Target Population**\n\nOur target population for Cleveland Clinic's services in Vietnam will be the growing middle and upper classes, who are increasingly seeking high-quality healthcare services.
