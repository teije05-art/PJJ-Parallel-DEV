# Enhanced Successful Planning Patterns

This file tracks proven approaches that work across all 4 agents.
Used for in-context learning and Flow-GRPO optimization.

## Agent-Specific Patterns:
- **Planner Agent**: Successful strategic approaches
- **Executor Agent**: Effective implementation methods
- **Verifier Agent**: Quality validation techniques
- **Generator Agent**: Synthesis best practices
