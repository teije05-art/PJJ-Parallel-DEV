# KPMG Project Procedures

## Governance and Stakeholder Management

Establish a governance structure with multiple layers of management control to ensure issues can be escalated to the appropriate level for risk mitigation and decision‑making


A Project Board ensures corporate policies, stage‑gate approvals, funding authorizations and change‑management procedures are followed.


Identify both internal and external stakeholders early, including boards, committees, consultants, contractors, regulators and end users.

Ensure stakeholders have a voice, participate in the management process and contribute to the project's success.

## Research and Analysis Requirements

Conduct thorough market research (size, growth, segmentation) and competitive analysis for each market-entry initiative.

Include a comprehensive risk assessment using KPMG's risk‑management methodology; identify risks and develop mitigation strategies.

## Methodology and Framework Standards

Follow KPMG's standard methodologies and frameworks (e.g., the Market Entry Strategy Blueprint) when planning and executing projects.

Use a deliverable‑focused approach: produce defined outputs such as market analysis reports, competitive intelligence analyses, risk assessments, project frameworks, implementation timelines and quality‑assurance checklists.

## Knowledge Management

Document and store all approved plans, execution logs, successful patterns and errors to build a knowledge base for future iterations.

## Implementation and Timeline Management

Include an implementation timeline with milestones, resource assignments and accountability; monitor progress and adjust as required.

## Quality Assurance

Perform quality‑assurance reviews at key stages to ensure deliverables meet KPMG standards and client expectations.

## Team Coordination

Engage cross‑functional teams and subject‑matter experts to ensure proper coordination across disciplines.

## Approval and Validation Process

Obtain human approval at defined checkpoints; incorporate feedback and resolve validation issues before proceeding.

## Continuous Improvement

Conduct post‑execution reviews to capture lessons learned and update patterns and procedures.

Continuously refine project procedures based on new insights, industry trends and client feedback; update this entity whenever guidelines evolve.
