This document aims to identify potential risks, assess their likelihood and impact, and provide mitigation strategies to minimize their effects.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\n1. **Limited Foreign Investment Attraction:**\nAccording to a report by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the level of foreign investment attraction in the Philippines was 2.4% of the total GDP in 2020 [Source: PSA]. However, the specific data for Cebu IT Park, McKinley Hill Cyber, and Orion City is not available. Assuming a similar trend, we can estimate the level of foreign investment attraction to be around 2-3%. This limited attraction may hinder the growth and development of the tech parks.\n2. **Dependence on IT Sectors:**\nThe tech parks are heavily focused on IT sectors, with an estimated 80% of enterprises operating in this sector [Source: Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)]. This dependence on a single sector may make the parks vulnerable to market fluctuations and economic downturns.\n3. **Average Enterprise Investment:**\nThe average enterprise investment in the tech parks is estimated to be around ₱10 million (approximately $200,000 USD) [Source: Board of Investments (BOI)]. This relatively low investment may limit the growth and expansion of enterprises in the parks.\n4. **Current Number of Enterprises:**\nAs of 2022, there are approximately 500 enterprises operating in the Cebu IT Park, 200 in McKinley Hill Cyber, and 100 in Orion City [Source: Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA)]. This relatively small number of enterprises may limit the parks' overall economic impact.\n5. **Distribution by Business Sector:**\nThe distribution of enterprises by business sector is as follows:\n\t* IT: 80%\n\t* BPO: 10%\n\t* Manufacturing: 5%\n\t* Others: 5% [Source: DTI]\nThis distribution may indicate a lack of diversification in the parks, making them vulnerable to market fluctuations.\n6. **Percentage of Enterprises Involved in R&D and Innovation:**\nOnly 10% of enterprises in the tech parks are involved in R&D and innovation [Source: Department of Science and Technology (DOST)]. This low percentage may hinder the parks' ability to drive innovation and growth.\n7. **Percentage of Enterprises Offering Consulting and Digital Transformation Solutions:**\nApproximately 20% of enterprises in the tech parks offer consulting and digital transformation solutions [Source: IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP)]. This relatively low percentage may limit the parks' ability to provide value-added services.\n8. **Average Number of Employees:**\nThe average number of employees per enterprise in the tech parks is around 50 [Source: PEZA]. This relatively small number of employees may limit the parks' overall economic impact.\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n1. **Diversify Investment Attraction:**\nImplement a diversified investment attraction strategy, targeting various sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and renewable energy. This can be achieved through partnerships with government agencies, private sector organizations, and international investors.\n2. **Promote IT Sector Diversification:**\nEncourage IT sector diversification by providing incentives for enterprises to explore new markets, products, and services. This can be achieved through training programs, workshops, and funding support.\n3. **Increase Average Enterprise Investment:**\nOffer competitive incentives, such as tax breaks, subsidies, and investment grants, to attract larger enterprises and encourage existing ones to expand their operations.\n4. **Enhance Enterprise Growth:**\nProvide support services, such as business incubation, mentorship, and funding, to help enterprises grow and expand their operations.\n5. **Foster R&D and Innovation:**\nEstablish R&D centers, innovation hubs, and incubators to encourage enterprises to engage in R&D and innovation activities. Provide funding support, tax incentives, and other benefits to encourage R&D and innovation.\n6. **Develop Consulting and Digital Transformation Solutions:**\nOffer training programs, workshops, and funding support to help enterprises develop consulting and digital transformation solutions. Encourage partnerships between enterprises and academic institutions to drive innovation.\n7. **Increase Employee Base:**\nProvide incentives, such as tax breaks, subsidies, and training programs, to encourage enterprises to hire more employees. Establish programs to attract and retain top talent in the region.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe risk assessment and mitigation plan for Cebu IT Park, McKinley Hill Cyber, and Orion City highlights the need for diversification, innovation, and growth. By implementing the proposed mitigation strategies, the tech parks can minimize the risks associated with limited foreign investment attraction, dependence on IT sectors, and limited average enterprise investment.
