# Jupiter for KPMG: Quick Talking Points
**One-Page Reference | Nov 20, 2025**

---

## YOUR OPENING (30 seconds)

*"I've been studying your tax research process, and I see a huge opportunity for Jupiter. Your workflow is solid—classify, search, compile. But Steps 2 and 3 are where most of the time goes, and that's exactly where AI can help. Before I propose something, I want to understand your specific process better."*

## THREE ELEMENTS OF THEIR WORKFLOW

### 1️⃣ CLASSIFICATION
- How do you decide which topic a question belongs to?
- Is it standardized across your team?
- **Jupiter's role**: Standardize + speed up

### 2️⃣ SEARCH (⭐ This is the main one)
- How many documents do you review per question?
- How long does it take?
- What makes a document "relevant"?
- **Jupiter's role**: Find all relevant docs in 1 minute (vs. 30-60 min)

### 3️⃣ COMPILATION
- Do you copy sections or synthesize?
- Who writes the final response?
- Who reviews it?
- **Jupiter's role**: Auto-synthesize from all docs (3-5 min vs. 30-60 min)

---

## WHAT JUPITER DOES

### The Big Picture
```
Manual: Question → Find docs manually → Write response
Jupiter: Question → Auto-find docs → Auto-synthesize → Review → Send
Result: Same quality, 10-20x faster
```

### For Search (The Game-Changer)
- Currently: You search SharePoint manually, might miss documents
- Jupiter: Searches entire database semantically (understands meaning, not just keywords)
- Result: All relevant documents found in 1 minute

### For Response Building
- Currently: Professional reads docs, synthesizes, writes
- Jupiter: AI reads docs, synthesizes, formats, cites sources
- Result: Same quality analysis, but 3-5 minutes instead of 30-60

### Full Flow
1. User enters question in Streamlit interface
2. Selects topic from dropdown (e.g., "Corporate Tax")
3. Jupiter searches entire KPMG database (1 minute)
4. Returns top 12 most relevant documents
5. Jupiter synthesizes response automatically (3-5 minutes)
6. Partner reviews and approves (5-10 minutes)
7. Response sent to client
8. System learns from approved response

**Total: 15-20 minutes** vs. **90-150 minutes**

## THE VALUE PROP

| Aspect | Current | Jupiter | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Time/Question** | 90-150 min | 15-20 min | **10-20x faster** |
| **Documents Found** | Manual (might miss) | All relevant | **Comprehensive** |
| **Quality** | Varies | Consistent | **Standardized** |
| **Capacity** | Current team | 3-5x volume | **Major scaling** |
| **Learning** | None | Every question | **Gets better** |

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

### For the Team
- Less repetitive search work → focus on strategy
- New people perform like senior staff
- Same professionals handle way more questions

### For the Firm
- Revenue: Serve 3-5x more clients
- Costs: 45% less time spent on search/synthesis
- Risk: Complete audit trail for compliance
- Competitiveness: Faster turnaround = happier clients

### For the Client
- Faster response (2-3 hours → 20 minutes)
- Better quality (comprehensive, properly cited)
- More consistent approach

---

## KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK

### On Process
1. "Walk me through your last client question—how long did it take?"
2. "How many documents did you review?"
3. "Is the search process consistent across your team?"

### On Pain
1. "What's the biggest bottleneck right now?"
2. "What if I could cut response time in half?"
3. "What's preventing you from handling more questions?"

### On Success
1. "What would success look like?"
2. "Is it about speed? Quality? Capacity? All three?"

## YOUR PROPOSAL (if they seem interested)

### Three Phases
1. **Week 1**: Import database, organize files, set up system
2. **Week 2**: Test with 10-15 real questions, get your feedback
3. **Week 3**: Train team, go live

### What You Get
- Fully operational system tailored to KPMG process
- Team trained and ready
- 87% faster response time
- Better quality (consistent format, comprehensive)
- Complete audit trail

### What We Need
- Your database files (✓ you have them)
- Your workflow details (topics, response format)
- Your approval process
- Desired timeline

## IF THEY SAY...

### "This sounds good, but I need to think about it"
→ "That's totally fair. Let me send you our full proposal document. Can we schedule 20 minutes next week to discuss? I'm confident this will work for your team."

### "How much time would this actually save?"
→ "If search currently takes you 40 minutes per question, Jupiter does it in 1 minute. If compilation takes 45 minutes, Jupiter does it in 5. So roughly 80 minutes saved per question. That's 6-8 hours per day for your team of 5."

### "What about quality? Isn't AI risky?"
→ "Valid concern. Jupiter's role is to synthesize from your documents, find relationships, and format professionally. Your team still reviews everything before it goes to clients. AI speeds up the grunt work, humans make the final call. It's about enhancing your experts, not replacing them."

### "What if we're not ready in 3 weeks?"
→ "No problem. We can adjust timeline based on your needs. The process is the same—import, test, refine, deploy. We go at your pace."

### "What happens if this doesn't work?"
→ "We validate extensively in Phase 2 with real questions. If results aren't meeting our standards, we refine before team-wide rollout. Your data stays on your systems, changes are reversible."

## IF THEY SEEM READY TO MOVE FORWARD

1. "Great! Let me ask a few more questions about your database and workflow so we can plan Phase 1"
2. (Use the detailed questions guide)
3. "Perfect. Here's what I'll do this week..."
4. Get their info, commit to next steps, schedule follow-up

---

## YOUR CLOSING (if going well)

*"I can see this solving a real problem for your team. The search automation is the game-changer—that alone saves most of the time. And the synthesis piece gives you consistency and better quality. Let me get your database imported and test this with a few of your real questions. I think you'll be impressed with what Jupiter can do."*

## REMEMBER

✓ Listen more than you talk (they're the experts)
✓ Drill into pain points (those are your gold)
✓ Use their numbers (if they say 40 min search, use that number)
✓ Validate assumptions (ask "is that right?")
✓ Show you understand their workflow
✓ Position Jupiter as helper, not replacement
✓ Leave them with the written proposal

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK

**Re-center**: "Let me make sure I understand... [repeat back what you heard]. Is that right?"

**Clarify**: "When you say that takes an hour, is that the search or the writing?"

**Connect**: "So if we automated the search piece, that would free up... what? 2-3 hours per person per day?"

**Confirm**: "That sounds like a big opportunity. Can I start with importing your database and testing?"

**Good luck! You've got this. 💪**
