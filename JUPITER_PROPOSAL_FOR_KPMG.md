# Project Jupiter: Tailored Solution for KPMG Tax Team

**Prepared for**: KPMG Tax & Legal Partners
**Date**: November 20, 2025
**Purpose**: Enhance tax research workflow with AI-powered document retrieval and response synthesis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your tax team's current workflow is efficient but labor-intensive:

```
Client Question → Manual Topic Classification → Manual Search → Manual Compilation
```

Project Jupiter automates and enhances this process:

```
Client Question → Guided Classification → Automated Search → AI Synthesis + Review
```

**Result**: Same high-quality responses in 10-15 minutes vs. 2-3 hours
- **10-20x faster** than current process
- **Better quality** (comprehensive, consistent, properly cited)
- **Scales** (same team handles 3-5x more questions)
- **Learns** (system gets smarter with each response)

---

## HOW JUPITER ENHANCES YOUR WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Topic Classification (Current)
**Your Process**: Tax professional reads question, determines topic category
**Current Approach**: Manual, varies by person
**Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Jupiter Enhancement**:
- Streamlit interface with dropdown of standard KPMG topics
- User selects topic (or Jupiter suggests, user confirms)
- Selection flows through entire system
- **Result**: More consistent, faster, traceable

---

### Step 2: Document Search (Current) ⭐ **MAJOR TIME SAVER**
**Your Process**: Navigate SharePoint, search keywords, manually browse folders
**Current Challenge**: Time-consuming, easy to miss documents, inconsistent results
**Time**: 30-60 minutes per question

**Jupiter Transformation**:
```
Traditional Search:
User thinks of keywords → Search SharePoint → Review results → Manually prioritize
                          (keyword matching only, easy to miss documents)

Jupiter Search:
System understands topic → Query entire database semantically → Auto-rank by relevance
                          (finds conceptual matches, never misses documents)

Time: ~1 minute (vs. 30-60 minutes)
Quality: Comprehensive (all relevant docs, not just keyword matches)
Consistency: Same approach every time
```

**What Happens**:
1. User selects topic in Jupiter interface
2. System instantly searches entire KPMG database:
   - Semantic understanding (not just keyword matching)
   - Considers regulations, guidance, precedents, advice letters
   - Returns top 10-15 most relevant documents
3. System shows why each document was selected
4. Documents are ranked by relevance
5. Ready for synthesis step

**Result**:
- ✓ All relevant documents found (no missed docs)
- ✓ Ranked by relevance automatically
- ✓ ~1 minute vs. 30-60 minutes
- ✓ Same result every time

---

### Step 3: Response Building (Current)
**Your Process**: Read all documents, extract key points, synthesize analysis, format, cite sources
**Current Approach**: Manual synthesis, human-dependent on writer skill
**Time**: 30-60 minutes per question
**Review**: Partner reviews for accuracy and completeness

**Jupiter Enhancement**:
```
Traditional Compilation:
Professional reads → Extracts → Synthesizes → Writes → Formats → Cites
(Time-intensive, quality varies)

Jupiter Synthesis:
System reads all docs → Identifies key relationships → Organizes by theme →
Synthesizes analysis → Structures output → Auto-cites
(Fast, consistent, comprehensive)

Time: 2-5 minutes (vs. 30-60 minutes)
Quality: Structured, comprehensive, properly cited
```

**What Happens**:
1. Jupiter receives top 12 relevant documents
2. System automatically:
   - Reads and understands each document
   - Identifies key regulations and guidance
   - Synthesizes relationships between documents
   - Organizes information by theme
   - Generates professional response structure:
     * Executive Summary
     * Relevant Regulations & Guidance (with citations)
     * KPMG Analysis & Recommendation
     * Risk Considerations
     * Next Steps
     * Complete Source Documentation
3. Response is sent to partner for review
4. Partner can approve as-is, or request modifications
5. If approved, system records as successful pattern

**Result**:
- ✓ Faster (2-5 min vs. 30-60 min)
- ✓ Consistent structure (professional every time)
- ✓ Complete (all documents considered)
- ✓ Properly cited (every claim tracked to source)
- ✓ Better for review (clear structure helps partner validate)

### ROI Calculation
**For a team of 5 professionals:**
- Current: ~150 minutes per question
- With Jupiter: ~15 minutes per question
- **Savings**: 135 minutes per question

**Per day (assuming 2 questions per person):**
- 5 people × 2 questions × 135 min = **1,350 minutes/day saved**
- **= 22.5 hours/day saved**
- **= ~45% capacity freed up**
